libvyosconfig
=============

This library mixes the multiway tree manipulation libraries from [vyconf](https://github.com/vyos/vyconf)
with a parser and a formatter for VyOS 1.x config format, and is meant to be used in config migration scripts
and analysis/conversion tools.

It is not really properly packaged now and has undeclared build dependencies on VyConf (obviously) and also
assumed that OCaml installation is per-user (through opam) rather than system-wide.

The main purpose is to provide bindings for Python, so using this library directly from C is strongly
discourages: not just the interface is not guaranteed to be stable, it's written to be a bridge between
two high level languages so it would be very inconvenient to use from C.
